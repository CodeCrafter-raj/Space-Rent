# 🏢 SpaceRent – Shared Space Booking Platform (MERN Stack)



SpaceRent is a full-stack web application that allows users to book shared spaces such as offices, libraries, and cafes on a rental basis. It also provides an admin panel for managing listings, availability, services, and generating booking reports. Built using the MERN stack, this project showcases key concepts of authentication, REST APIs, dynamic routing, role-based access, and data integration.
